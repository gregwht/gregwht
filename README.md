### Hi! I’m Greg. 

I'm an audio professional currently based in London, U.K. 

I love working across all aspects of sound, from the artistic to the technical. I have worked on large-scale projects for clients including BBC Proms, London Borough of Culture, Hampton Court Palace, the Museum of the Future, and Opera North. For my full bio [click here](https://www.gregory-white.co.uk/bio.html).

* 👨🏼‍💻 As an audio programmer I enjoy building creative tools for musical expression.
* 🔊 As a technical audio designer I love crafting interactive and spatial audio experiences.
* 🎤 As a sound designer I specialise in field recording and environmental sound design.
* 🎶 And as a composer my passion is making generative and experimental music.

Currently contributing to [SignalFlow](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow), a framework for real-time sound synthesis, processing, and DSP with Python.
